                        <p>
                            Credit Card Fraud Detection is an innovative project focused on creating a robust system for
                            detecting fraudulent credit card transactions within a dataset of over 284,000 records,
                            marked by a significant class imbalance. The project leverages three machine learning
                            algorithmsâ€”Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forestâ€”to effectively analyze
                            transaction data. To address the challenge of class imbalance, the Synthetic Minority
                            Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is employed to generate synthetic samples for the minority
                            class, thereby improving the modelsâ€™ detection capabilities. By integrating these advanced
                            methodologies, the project aims to deliver a reliable and accurate solution for credit card
                            fraud detection, underscoring the transformative potential of machine learning in enhancing
                            financial security.
